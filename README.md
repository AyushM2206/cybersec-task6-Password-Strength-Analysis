## 📊 Analysis Table

| Password             | Tool Used         | Strength      | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback Summary                              |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `ayush123`           | passwordmeter     | Weak (39%)    | Seconds               | Too short, lowercase + numbers only           |
| `ayush@2025`         | security.org      | Medium (73%)  | Hours                 | Better with special char, but still predictable |
| `@Yush_20!25#Secure` | passwordmeter     | Very Strong (100%) | 100+ years         | Excellent — mix of cases, symbols, length     |

## 💡 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use **12–16+ characters**
- Mix **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid **names**, **birth years**, or **dictionary words**
- Never **reuse passwords** on multiple accounts
- Use a **password manager** (like Bitwarden or KeePass)

## 🛡️ Understanding Common Attacks

### 🔸 Brute Force Attack
Tries every possible combination. Short and simple passwords like `ayush123` are quickly broken.

### 🔸 Dictionary Attack
Uses lists of common passwords and patterns. Predictable passwords like `ayush@2025` are vulnerable.

✅ A strong password like `@Yush_20!25#Secure` is highly resistant to both.

## 📌 Outcome
This task helped me:
- Understand what makes passwords strong or weak
- Test passwords using trusted online tools
- Learn how to avoid common password mistakes
- Gain awareness of real-world password cracking attacks
